# Character Sheet Generator

This generator will generate a usable character sheet, based on the player character (PC) model, in PDF format.

The generator uses PyLatex. In order for the character sheet generator to work, you must install `latexmk` on your machine separately. In the future, a script may be written to automate this process.
